# Agent Analyser

![Repo Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Roelzz&label=Repo%20Views&color=0e75b6&style=flat)

Parses Microsoft Copilot Studio bot exports and live Dataverse environments — generates architecture reports, runs best-practice rules, compares bots, and aggregates conversation analytics. Includes a full web UI.

## Why Agent Analyser

- **Full visibility into bot architecture** — see every topic, skill, entity, knowledge source, and how they connect, in one report
- **Best-practice rules out of the box** — 18 configurable rules catch misconfigurations before they hit production, with custom YAML rules support
- **Batch conversation analytics** — aggregate transcripts to surface success rates, topic usage, error patterns, and credit estimates
- **Bot comparison** — diff two bot exports side by side to see what changed in components, instructions, settings, and connections
- **Catch issues with AI-powered lint** — instruction audit checks guardrails, topic structure, and component health
- **Your data stays yours** — runs locally or self-hosted in your own tenant. No data is sent externally (except to OpenAI/Anthropic if you opt into the Lint feature)
- **Works with exports and live Dataverse** — upload a `.zip` export, or connect directly to your environment and auto-analyse on login

## What You Can Do

| Feature | Description |

| **Upload bot export** | Drop a `.zip`, or `botContent.yml` + `dialog.json` — get a full architecture report with quick wins |
| **Connect to Dataverse** | Device-code auth to your environment, auto-analyses your bot the moment you connect |
| **Conversation transcripts** | Upload or fetch transcripts from Dataverse — sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, event logs |
| **Single conversation lookup** | Fetch and analyse a specific conversation by ID directly from Dataverse |
| **Batch analytics** | Aggregate multiple transcripts — success/failure/escalation rates, topic usage, error patterns, credit estimates |
| **Bot comparison** | Compare two bot profiles — components added/removed/changed, instructions diff, topic connections, settings |
| **Custom rules** | 18 default best-practice rules + user-defined YAML rules, evaluated during analysis and solution checks |
| **Solution tools** | Check, validate, analyse dependencies, or rename Power Platform solution ZIP exports |
| **Instruction lint** | AI-powered audit of bot instructions and architecture (supports OpenAI and Anthropic models) |

| **Analysis counter** | Tracks how many analyses you've run, with cat-themed gamification milestones |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) package manager

### macOS / Linux (Terminal)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Roelzz/Agent_analyser.git
cd Agent_analyser
cp .env.example .env       # edit credentials in .env
uv sync
uv run reflex run
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Roelzz/Agent_analyser.git
cd Agent_analyser
Copy-Item .env.example .env   # edit credentials in .env
uv sync
uv run reflex run
```

### Windows (CMD)

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Roelzz/Agent_analyser.git
cd Agent_analyser
copy .env.example .env        REM edit credentials in .env
uv sync
uv run reflex run
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), sign in, upload a `.zip` bot export or connect to Dataverse.

> **Privacy note:** Deploy this locally or self-host in your own Azure tenant. Bot exports and Dataverse data never leave your machine. The only external call is to OpenAI or Anthropic if you use the Instruction Lint feature.

### CLI

```bash
uv run python main.py path/to/botContent --all
```

Scans all subfolders containing `botContent.yml` + `dialog.json` and writes a `report.md` into each. If a `Transcripts/` subfolder exists, every `.json` transcript gets a matching `.md` report.

Single folder:

```bash
uv run python main.py path/to/botContent_folder
uv run python main.py path/to/botContent_folder -o custom_report.md
```

## Quick Wins (Built-in Rules)

Every bot analysis automatically evaluates a set of built-in heuristic checks against the parsed `BotProfile`. Results appear in the **Quick Wins** section of the report with emoji severity indicators (🔴 fail, 🟡 warning, 🔵 info).

These are hardcoded checks — no configuration needed. They catch structural issues that are easy to miss when reading raw bot config.

### Component Checks

| Check | Severity | What it catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Disabled topics | warning | Topics with state ≠ Active — enable or remove to reduce clutter |
| No trigger queries | warning | User topics without trigger phrases — recognizer can never match them |
| Weak descriptions | info | Topics, tools, agents, etc. with missing, too-short, or display-name-matching descriptions |
| Missing system topics | warning | Missing `OnError`, `OnUnknownIntent`, or `OnEscalate` handlers |
| Unused global variables | info | Global variables whose schema name isn't referenced by other components (heuristic) |

### Connection Checks

| Check | Severity | What it catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing connector definition | warning | Connection reference points to a connector ID with no matching definition |
| Duplicate connection reference | warning | Same logical name appears more than once |
| Orphaned connector definition | info | Connector defined but not referenced by any connection reference |
| Unused connection reference | info | Connection reference defined but not used by any component |

Custom rules (see below) are evaluated after these built-in checks and appended to the same Quick Wins section.

## Custom Rules

Rules are YAML-based conditions evaluated against the `BotProfile` model. They run during bot analysis (appended to Quick Wins in reports) and during solution checks.

### Default Rules

Agent Analyser ships with 18 best-practice rules across 4 categories:

| ID | Category | Severity | What it checks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BP001 | Architecture | warning | No conversation starters defined |
| BP002 | Architecture | warning | No system instructions configured |
| BP003 | Architecture | warning | No explicit model hint configured |
| BP004 | Architecture | warning | Authentication mode is Unknown |
| BP005 | Architecture | info | No GPT description set |
| BP017 | Architecture | warning | Instructions lack constraint/boundary language |
| BP018 | Architecture | info | No escalation or handoff guidance in instructions |
| BP006 | Security | fail | Content moderation is Unknown |
| BP007 | Security | fail | Sensitive properties logged to Application Insights |
| BP008 | Security | warning | Access control policy is Unknown |
| BP009 | Security | warning | Instructions don't mention data handling or privacy |
| BP011 | Knowledge | info | Code interpreter is enabled |
| BP012 | Knowledge | info | Web browsing is enabled |
| BP010 | Operations | info | Automatic model updates enabled |
| BP013 | Operations | warning | No Application Insights configured |
| BP014 | Operations | warning | Activity logging disabled in Application Insights |
| BP015 | Operations | warning | No deployment channels configured |
| BP016 | Operations | info | No knowledge sources configured |

### YAML Format

```yaml
rules:
  - rule_id: BP001
    severity: warning          # fail | warning | info
    category: Architecture     # free-text grouping
    message: "No conversation starters defined"
    condition:
      field: "gpt_info.conversation_starters"
      operator: eq             # eq | not_exists | not_contains
      value: []
```

**Field paths** reference `BotProfile` attributes using dot notation. Use `[]` for array fields (e.g. `channels`, `knowledge_sources`).

**Supported operators:**

- `eq` — field equals the given value
- `not_exists` — field is `None` or missing
- `not_contains` — string field does not contain the given substring

### Configuration

Set `CUSTOM_RULES_FILE` in `.env` to point to your rules file. Falls back to `data/default_rules.yaml` if unset.

```bash
CUSTOM_RULES_FILE=data/default_rules.yaml
```

### Where Rules Appear

- **Analysis reports** — Quick Wins section with emoji severity indicators (🔴 fail, 🟡 warning, 🔵 info) and styled badges
- **Solution checker** — custom rules run alongside built-in check categories
- **Rules page** (`/rules`) — view, edit, and manage rules in the web UI

## What It Extracts

**From `botContent.yml`:**

- Bot metadata (name, ID, channels, recognizer, orchestrator detection)
- AI configuration (GPT component model, instructions, knowledge sources, capabilities)
- All components with kind, state, triggers, dialog types
- Topic connection graph (which topics call which via `BeginDialog`)
- Trigger query overlap detection
- Security inventory (auth mode, access control, content moderation, App Insights config)
- MCS credit estimation

**From `dialog.json`:**

- Full conversation timeline (user messages, bot responses, plan steps, knowledge searches, errors)
- Execution phases with duration and status
- Mermaid sequence diagram of the conversation flow
- Mermaid Gantt chart of execution timing

**From Dataverse (live connection):**

- Bot config and all components fetched via Web API
- Auto-triggers full bot analysis after device-code authentication
- Conversation transcripts with browse, search, and single-ID lookup
- Schema lookup preserved across transcript analyses for accurate topic resolution

**From transcript `.json` files:**

- Session metadata (outcome, outcome reason, turn count, implied success, duration)
- Variable assignments and dialog redirects
- Same conversation timeline rendering (sequence diagram, Gantt chart, event log)

**Quick Wins (custom rules):**

- Evaluated against `BotProfile` with emoji severity indicators (🔴 🟡 🔵)
- Styled badges rendered in the analysis report

**Instruction Lint (AI-powered):**

- Audit of bot instructions, guardrails, topic architecture, and component health
- Automatically detects the bot's AI model provider (OpenAI or Anthropic) and uses the matching API
- Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` and/or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` (depending on the bot's configured model)

## Report Structure

Each generated report contains:

1. **TL;DR** — one-line bot summary with key stats
2. **AI Configuration** — GPT model, knowledge sources, web browsing, code interpreter, system instructions (collapsible)
3. **Bot Profile** — Schema name, bot ID, channels, recognizer, AI settings
4. **Quick Wins** — custom rules results with severity badges
5. **Components** — smart categorization (User/Orchestrator/System/Automation Topics, Knowledge, Skills, Entities, Variables, Settings) with tailored columns per category
6. **Trigger Overlaps** — topics with similar trigger queries that may compete
7. **Topic Connection Graph** — Mermaid flowchart of topic-to-topic calls with conditions
8. **Security Inventory** — auth mode, access control, content moderation, App Insights settings
9. **Tool Inventory** — action/connector tools available in orchestrator bots
10. **Knowledge Inventory** — knowledge sources with type and configuration
11. **Integration Map** — Mermaid diagram of external connections
12. **Credit Estimate** — MCS message credit estimation based on bot features
13. **Conversation Trace** — sequence diagram, Gantt chart, phase breakdown, event log, errors

Transcript reports contain:

1. **Title** — derived from the JSON filename
2. **Session Summary** — start/end time, session type, outcome, turn count, implied success
3. **Conversation Trace** — sequence diagram, Gantt chart, phase breakdown, event log

## Batch Analytics

Aggregate multiple conversation transcripts to get a bird's-eye view of bot performance.

**What it aggregates:**

- Total conversations, success/failure/escalation rates
- Topic usage frequency
- Error patterns and common failure reasons
- MCS credit estimates across conversations

**How to use:**

1. Connect to Dataverse and fetch transcripts
2. Select the transcripts you want to analyse
3. Click **Run Batch Analysis** — results render on the `/batch` page

## Bot Comparison

Compare two bot exports side by side to understand what changed between versions or environments.

**What it compares:**

- Components added, removed, and changed
- Instructions diff (line-by-line)
- Topic connection changes
- Settings differences

**How to use:**

1. Navigate to `/compare`
2. Upload two bot exports (`.zip` or `botContent.yml` + `dialog.json`)
3. View the diff report with additions, removals, and changes highlighted

## Solution Tools

Four tools for working with Power Platform solution ZIP exports, available on the `/tools` page:

| Tab | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Check** | Runs built-in checks (SOL, AGT, TOP, KNO, SEC, ORCH categories) + custom rules against the solution |
| **Validate** | AI-powered instruction validation against model best practices |
| **Dependencies** | Analyses component dependencies within the solution |
| **Rename** | Renames solution components (publisher prefix, display names) |

Built-in check categories:

- **SOL** — solution-level checks (structure, metadata)
- **AGT** — agent/bot configuration checks
- **TOP** — topic structure and trigger checks
- **KNO** — knowledge source checks
- **SEC** — security configuration checks
- **ORCH** — orchestrator bot checks

Custom rules (from your YAML file) also run during solution checks alongside these built-in categories.

## Runtime Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REFLEX_ENV` | `dev` | `dev` = separate ports, `prod` = single-port mode |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | `3000` | Frontend port (dev mode only) |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | `8000` | Backend port (dev mode only) |
| `REFLEX_HOT_RELOAD_EXCLUDE_PATHS` | `data` | Exclude paths from hot-reload watcher (prevents bot_profile wipe) |
| `PORT` | `2009` | Single port for prod mode (`--single-port`) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) |
| `USERS` | _(none)_ | Web UI credentials, comma-separated `user:pass` pairs |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | _(none)_ | OpenAI API key for Instruction Lint (required for OpenAI-model bots) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | _(none)_ | Anthropic API key for Instruction Lint (required for Anthropic-model bots) |
| `CUSTOM_RULES_FILE` | `data/default_rules.yaml` | Path to YAML file with custom rules for analysis and solution checks |

## Deployment

> **Recommendation:** Self-host this in your own tenant or run it locally. Bot configuration data and conversation transcripts are sensitive — keep them under your control.

Single-port mode — one exposed port serves everything.

### Nixpacks (Coolify / Railway)

Configure these env vars in your platform:

```bash
REFLEX_ENV=prod
PORT=2009
USERS=admin:secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # optional, enables Lint for OpenAI-model bots
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... # optional, enables Lint for Anthropic-model bots
```

The `Procfile` runs `reflex run --env prod --single-port`. Set `REFLEX_ENV=prod` so `rxconfig.py` uses the single `PORT` for both frontend and backend.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t agent-analyser .
docker run -p 2009:2009 --env-file .env agent-analyser
```

Make sure `.env` contains at least `REFLEX_ENV=prod` and `PORT=2009`.

## Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # edit credentials
uv sync
uv run pytest              # 247 tests
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
uv run reflex run          # dev server — frontend :3000, backend :8000
